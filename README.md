[EcoForecast](https://ecoforecast.info/) is a web application that allows users to visualize and analyze future ecological changes in the sagebrush habitat across the United States with climate change scenarios. The app utilizes data generated using the [STEPWAT2 simulation model](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/STEPWAT2) and is built using React and [Google Earth Engine JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine). 

This app is made possible by the support of [Yale University](https://environment.yale.edu/), the [United States Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/), [Marshall University](https://www.marshall.edu/), and [Utah State University](https://www.usu.edu/).
